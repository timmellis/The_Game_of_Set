    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>The object of the game is to identify a Set of 3 cards and remove them from the board.</p>
    <p>Each card has one of 3 symbols (ovals, rectangles, diamonds), one of 3 numbers (1-shape, 2-shapes, 3-shapes), one of 3 colors (teal, purple, orange), and one of 3 shadings (filled-in, outlined, shaded).</p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A Set consists of 3 cards in which <b>each</b> of the cards' features are either <b>all the same</b> on each card, or, are <b>all different</b> on each card. All of the features must separately satisfy this rule.<i>(In other words: shape must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3 cards; color must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3, etc.)</i></p>

    <h4>Game Play</h4>

    <p>12 cards are played to the table. The player clicks on three cards they believe comprise a Set. If they meet the requirements, they are removed from the board and 3 new cards are placed. Otherwise, they remain on the table and play continues.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div id="instr-examples-container">
     
      <div class="instr-example-wrapper"> 
        Same number, same color, <br /> same shape, different shading: 
        
        <div class="instr-example">
          <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="C-empty-oval-1">
            <div class="shape-object color-C fill-empty shape-oval"></div></div>
            <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="C-striped-oval-1"><div class="shape-object color-C fill-striped shape-oval"></div></div>
            <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="C-filled-oval-1"><div class="shape-object color-C fill-filled shape-oval"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div class="instr-example-wrapper"> 
        Different number, different color,<br /> different shape, different shading: 
        <div class="instr-example">
          <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="A-empty-oval-1">
            <div class="shape-object color-A fill-empty shape-oval"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="B-striped-numeral-2">
            <div class="shape-object color-B fill-striped shape-numeral"></div>
            <div class="shape-object color-B fill-striped shape-numeral"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="card-demo card-wrapper" id="C-filled-diamond-3">
            <div class="shape-object color-C fill-filled shape-diamond"></div>
            <div class="shape-object color-C fill-filled shape-diamond"></div>
            <div class="shape-object color-C fill-filled shape-diamond"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p>If there is not a Set on the board, 3 more cards can be dealt to the table. Those 3 cards are not replaced when the next Set is found, reducing the number back to 12.</p>

    <h4>Game Modes</h4>

    <p>The traditional game of SET is generally played with all four criteria required for each Set, which can be difficult. In this game, you can select a difficulty level to make your game play the most enjoyable:</p> 
      <ul id="instr-mode-list">
        <li><b>"Novice"</b> requires only numbers and colors to make a Set.</li>
          <li><b>"Intermediate"</b> requires numbers, colors and shapes to make a Set.</li>
          <li><b>"Expert"</b> is the full traditional game play.</li>
          <li><b>"Ya Basic"</b> requires only numbers, and is largely included for very young players or for testing purposes.</li>
        </ul> 
    <p>Once a Game Mode is selected and the cards are dealt, the Game Mode is locked and cannot be changed.</p>

    <p class="instructions-note">Fun Fact:<br />In full traditional game play, there are ~ 33:1 odds that a Set is present in 12 cards, and ~ 2500:1 odds when 15 cards are on the table.</p>

    <h4>Score</h4>
    <p>Each Set is worth 3 points, times a multiplier that is based on your selected Game Mode difficulty level, (1x for basic, 2x for novice, 3x for intermediate, and 4x for expert). If the player requires a first hint, score is reduced by 1 x multiplier; a second hint costs 2 x multipler, (in other words, you get no points for using both hints). </p>
    <p>All that said, I personally do not pay attention to the score at all and would rather enjoy the game as a simple yet complex game of solitaire. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Enjoy!</p>
